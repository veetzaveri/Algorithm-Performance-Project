The Python IDE used is Python IDLE and is Python 3.9 64-bit. 

There is only one Python file and does not depend on any others so simply run this one py file!

All the text output files will be printed to Lab 4 Folder when python program is ran.

These txt files or output files will be labled as normal, random, or reverse and the number of integers
that it sorted will be put in the txt file name as well so it can be easily identified.
